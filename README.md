  isGame:Two is a single-player platformer RPG. It is a continuation of development for [isGameTrue](https://github.com/brandonkylely/isGame-True).

  Assume the role of a hooded swordsman in this 8-bit style RPG adventure! Orcs and pigs spawn throughout each level to try and stop you in your tracks, so only the bravest adventurers will make it through. At the end of each game, users can submit their total scores to a global leaderboard to see how they stack up against the best of the best!

  ### Game Instructions

  Use space bar to jump and WASD keys for direction movement and sword aiming. Use P to pause the game and take a break 💤. Collect coins and defeat enemies to gain points, and enter the door to move to the next stage! Avoid being hit too many times, as getting hit reduces your end-of-stage point multiplier and losing all lives will result in a game over!
